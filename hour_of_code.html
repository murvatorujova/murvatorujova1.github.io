        with the primary goal of fostering students' interest in computer science. Witnessing the enthusiasm 
        in the eyes of the students, we were inspired to extend the event beyond its initial scope. One of our
         team members took the initiative to teach coding to students in Zaqatala using code.org. According to
          her, the experience was both captivating and insightful. Despite being less familiar with coding, 
          the students displayed remarkable eagerness and ultimately succeeded by the end of the session.</p>
